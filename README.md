# BrainStation Data Science Capstone Template

This is a template repository for setting up your capstone project: it includes a simple folder structure and placeholder files for the most important assets you will be creating.

## Usage

1. Start a new GitHub repo using this template.
2. Update your `LICENSE` file with date and owner.
3. Update your `README.md` file to reflect the project - see a sample structure below and please refer to Synapse on what needs to be included here. 
4. Set up and activate your conda environment:
    - Create a new `conda` environment for your capstone project.
    - Activate the environment and export:
        ```bash
        conda env export > conda.yml
        ```
    - Make sure re-export every time after you update the environment.
    - You can reset your conda environment by running:
        ```bash
        conda env create -f conda.yml
        conda activate <your-env-name>
        ```
5. Add your own notebooks in `./notebooks/` and remove placeholders.
6. Add your own data in `./data/` and remove placeholder. Note: `.gitignore` will ignore the data folder when you push to github, save a copy of your raw and processed data, pickled models in a Google Drive folder and add the link in the `data_links.md` file.
7. Add your project documents, figures, reports, presentation pdf's in the `./docs` and remove placeholders.
8. Add your references (tutorials, papers, books etc.) in `./references`. 
9. Add your own scripts in `./src/` and remove unnecessary folders.

Feel free to rename the folder and customize the project structure to best fit your work - this template is just the starting point.

## Project Title
=========================

### Executive Summary

... Define the problem
... What is the data science opportunity
... Key takeaways

### Demo

... Show your work:
...     Data visualizations
...     Interactive demo (e.g., `streamlit` app)
...     Short video of users trying out the solution


### Methodology

... High-level diagrams of entire process:
...     various data processing steps
...     various modelling directions
...     various prototyping directions


### Organization

#### Repository 

* `data` 
    - contains link to copy of the dataset (stored in a publicly accessible cloud storage)
    - saved copy of aggregated / processed data as long as those are not too large (> 10 MB)

* `model`
    - `joblib` dump of final model(s)

* `notebooks`
    - contains all final notebooks involved in the project

* `docs`
    - contains final report, presentations which summarize the project

* `references`
    - contains papers / tutorials used in the project

* `src`
    - Contains the project source code (refactored from the notebooks)

* `.gitignore`
    - Part of Git, includes files and folders to be ignored by Git version control

* `conda.yml`
    - Conda environment specification

* `README.md`
    - Project landing page (this page)

* `LICENSE`
    - Project license

#### Dataset

... Google Drive links to datasets and pickled models

### Credits & References

... Include any personal learning
